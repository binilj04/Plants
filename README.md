# Plan A PLant

- Buying a plant is not very intuitive, especially if your new. A community driven plateform where people can share their experiences and others can learn and give their feedback.
- Initiatives like Plant a Tree Campain will be integrated where people can discover places for planting trees and make it a great learning and community experience.
- Have problems while growing a plant or making use of your kitchen waste to make natual fertiliser? Tons of resources from people from all walks of life who have been there and done it.
